<h2> MY INVOLVEMENT</h2>
<hr color="gray">
<h3> Cultural Unit Theatre (CUTE) - UiTMCK 2019 </h3>

<h3> Theatre Melati and Melur</h3>
<p align="center" style="font-size: 13pt; font-family:times new roman;">For Theatre Melati and Melur, I joined as a backstage crew with a few of my friends. As for this event, we all have to wear black color from head to toe in order to hide ourselves from being noticed by the audience when we are going to replace the props. The preparation for this theatre event took almost a month and we have meetings back and forth for the whole month. It is kind of tiring but it's all worth the memory. From this event, I gained a lot of knowledge about how an event is handled and how all the crew from different departments work behind the stage.</p>

<h3> Gemafusion</h3>
<p align="center" style="font-size: 13pt; font-family:times new roman;">For Gemafusion, it is an event that has a lot of segments such as singing, modeling, dancing, etc. I joined this event once again as a backstage crew along with my roommates. It was the event after Theatre Melati and Melur. Under this event, a lot of students from different semesters and different faculties joined and performed on the stage. From what I can see, students were able to show off their talents to the public. And yes, despite being tired, itâ€™s all worth the memory and knowledge that I had gained.</p>

<h2> MY WORKING EXPERIENCE</h2>
<hr color="gray">
<h3> ZTIE Home Tuition - January to July 2018</h3>
<img src="images/work experience.jpg" height="300px" width="200px" alt="work experience">
<p align="center" style="font-size: 13pt; font-family:times new roman;">I used to work as a teacher's assistant after taking my SPM for the time period from January to July 2018. I had to prepare all the learning materials for the teacher. I am also in charge of taking the attendance of students and receiving the payment from the parents. ZTIE Home Tuition only takes standard 2 and 3 students and focuses on students that are not excellent in learning and writing.</p>
